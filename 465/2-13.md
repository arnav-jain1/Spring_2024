# Metasploit Overview

## Exploits
Pieces of software, chunks of data, or sequences of commands that take advantage of a bug/glitch/vulnerability 
Goal: Cause unintended behavior to occur (like getting control of the system, allowing root access)

Remote Exploits: Work over a network and do not require prior access to the system 
Local Exploits: Requires prior access to the system and usually increases the privileges of the attacker (ex: Cycle servers)  

### Resources
There are resources that contain information and code for exploiting different vulnerabilities

## Metasploit
Was a portable network tool in perl in 2003
Turned into a pen testing framework in Ruby around 2007
Modular approach: Any payload with any exploit
Been deemed as dangerous but it is an industry standard 
Adopted by Rapid7 
	Gave it a GUI, scanning capabilities, and automatic exploit execution (Metasploit Pro) 

4 Main modules
	Exploits: Actual exploit to target vulnerabilities 
	Payloads: Code to run remotely
	Auxiliary: Includes port scanners, fuzzers, and customization tools
	Encoders: Convert one format to another
