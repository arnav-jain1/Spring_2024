# Reconnaissance
2 steps 
Step 1:
	Open source intelligence gathering
		Social Engineering
		Physical Break-ins
		Dumpster Diving
Step 2:
	Scanning
		Use of scanning tools to automatically scan Services, vulnerabilities, hosts. etc.
The Harvester:
	Tool for getting email, name, and other stuff
	The legality depends on how it is used. (don't spam it and send too many requests)
	-d is domain to search
	-b is the source (search engine) 
	-l is the limit of resul
Nmap
	Portscanner, ping sweep, and OS fingerprinting tool
	Nmap sends packets in different ways to try and find open ports
	Kind of like throwing stones at a house to map out a shape of it
	Ping sweep
		Example: nmap -sP targetIP
	TCP connect
		Three-way handshake nmap \[-sT] targetIP
		or nmap \[-sS] target IP
		Send a packet, recieve a packet, send another packet to establish connection
			Sends SYN
			Await SYN Ack
			Send nothing or RST
	UDP
		Send a UDP packet but does not receive a response
		nmap -sU targetIP 
		Useful when a lot of data is being sent
		If the packet is returned then the port is closed
		If no packet is returned then the port is open
	Xmas Tree scan Mode
		Send TCP segment to a target port with FIN, URG, and PSH code bits set (violation of TCP specification)
		If RST is returned then closed otherwise open
		-sN
	Other opetions
		-p: Set port ranges
		Set source ports so it doesn't get blocked
		Use decoys
