## Exploits
Pieces of software, chunks of data, or sequences of commands that take advantage of a bug/glitch/vulnerability to get *unintended* behavior to occur (like getting control of the system, allowing root access)

Remote Exploits: Work over a network and do not require prior access to the system 
Local Exploits: Requires prior access to the system and usually increases the privileges of the attacker (ex: Cycle servers)  



There are resources that contain information and code for exploiting different vulnerabilities such as https://www.exploit-db.com/

## Examples
In Ubuntu 11 and below, you can buffer overflow the ftp client and get higher privileges without the password
In Apache 1.3.x, 2.0.x through 2.0.64, and 2.2.x through 2.2.19 attackers can increase CPU utilization a lot to deny actual users access
# Metasploit
Was a portable network tool in perl in 2003
Turned into a pen testing framework in Ruby around 2007
Modular approach: Any payload with any exploit
Been deemed as dangerous but it is an industry standard 
Adopted by Rapid7 
	Gave it a GUI, scanning capabilities, and automatic exploit execution (Metasploit Pro) 

4 Main modules
	Exploits: Actual exploit to target vulnerabilities 
	Payloads: Code to run remotely
	Auxiliary: Includes port scanners, fuzzers, and customization tools
	Encoders: Convert one format to another

All of these 4 together allow metasploit to exploit vulnerabilities
