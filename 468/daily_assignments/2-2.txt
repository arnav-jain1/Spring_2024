1. True because object2 is pointing to the same value that object1 is pointing to so it will return True
2. False because they are pointing to completely different objects so it will return false
3. 15 because it has the same values as object1 so when object1 was changed to 15 object2 got changed as well
4. 10 because object3 value was set at 10 and hasn't been changed.
