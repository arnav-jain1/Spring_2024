    /* The 'let line = "-"' is creating a variable named line that has "-" as its value. 
    The variable is deleted after the for loop is finished

    The second part of the for loop checks the length of the var before each iteration and if the length 
    of the line is smaller than 7 it keeps looping and doing the body of the for loop. If it is not, it 
    goes to after the curly brace }

    The last part adds a "-" to the end of the line var after each iteration
