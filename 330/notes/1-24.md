# Sorting

## Divide and Conquer

* Divide the subproblem recursively into tiny subproblems
* Solve the subproblems
* Combine all the subproblems to form a solution

## Merge Sort

* Divide the array into two subarrays
* Sort the subarrays recursively doing merge sort
* Once the subarrays is small enough sort it
* Combine it

* To merge the two sorted arrays, go through each element of L and R and just add the smallest element to the new array and move the pointer accordingly O(n) time

* Insert sort and merge sort used together because insert sort is faster in smaller arrays
  * Ex when there are <=4 elements use insert sort
