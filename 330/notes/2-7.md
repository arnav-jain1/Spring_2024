# Quicksort

Divide: Partition A into 2 subarrays such that A\[:mid] $\le$ A\[mid] and A\[mid:] $\ge$ A\[mid]
Conquer: Sort by recursing
Combine: No need since it is in place

Partitioning: Selects the pivot point and rearranges the elements of the array between the pivot point (less is to left, more is to right)

## Time complexity
If the list is completely unbalanced the sorting time is $\theta$(n^2) because the amount of recursion is n (one recurse has 0 the other has n-1)
Best case is  is $\theta$(nlogn) because the partitioning is even so it recurses logn times:
$T(n) = 2T(\frac{n}{2}) + \theta(n)$   => master method => $n^{\log_{2}2} = n^{1}= n$ => case 2 => $\theta(n*logn)$ 
Average case is also the same. We can use indicator random variable to get a random list and avoid the worst-case
Can use median of multiple numbers as the pivot number if needed
