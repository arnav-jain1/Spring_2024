# Data Structures
## Sets
Collection of values 
Can be manipulated by algorithms and changed (insert, delete, search, etc)
Attributes of a dynamic set:
	key: used to identify the object 
	Satellite data: Other information about the object that is more general
	Other data: Pointers to other objects
Some dynamic sets assume there is some resemblance of order in a set
Dynamic Sets examples:
	arrays, stacks/queues, graphs, linked lists, skip lists, trees hash tables, disjoint sets

## Set operations
1. Queries: return information about the set
2. Modifying operations: Change the set
Time to do the operation is measured in terms of the set being of size n

## Array
Continues sequence of memory space
Matrix are just two dimensional arrays but they can be represented as one continues block of memory
Single array: more efficient
Multiple array: more flexible 
takes $\theta(1)$ to access any matrix element directly 

## Stacks/Queues
Dynamic sets where insert and remove is prespecified
Stacks: Last in first out
	Insert is called push 
	Delete is called pop
	Can be implimented with an array that is \[1:n] elements long
	S\[1] is the bottom element of the stack while S\[n] is the top element

	All 3 operations are $\theta(1)$
Queues: First in first out
	Insert is called enqueue
	Remove is called dequeue
	Needs one element of buffer so n -1 can be implemented as S\[1:n]
	Q.head is the start of the queue, next to be removed
	Q.tail is the end of the queue, the last element that was added
	Q.size is the max capacity of the queue + 1
	A queue is circular, it wraps around, so if Q.head == Q.tail == 1 then it is empty
	Full queue is if the Q.head == 1 and Q.tail position == Q.size

	Time complexity is $\theta(1)$
