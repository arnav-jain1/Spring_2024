# Heap
## Heap
Array that can be viewed as a binary tree
Each row is filled except the last row

Parent index = i // 2
Left child = 2i
Right child = 2i + 1

Height: logn

Max_heap: Largest element at the top (root), parent always more than children
Min_heap: Smallest element at the top (root), parent always less than children

### Max Heapify
Recursive procedure that maintains the max_heap property

Running time is O(logn) because you do it for each level in the height

Build max heap calls max heapify for every element

Runtime is O(nlogn) but a tighter analysis says that it is O(n) since it isn't called for half the leafs

## Heapsort
Makes a heap based on an unsorted list
