## Runtime of linkedlist
Insert run time is O(n) because in LL you have to traverse the entire list just to find the element to add
Delete and search run time is O(n) for same reason

Skip Lists aid this by reducign the search time to O(logn)
# Skip Lists
Randomized data structures built upon sorted linked lists but insert, delete, search done in O(logn) instead of O(n)
Skip lists have multiple sorted lists and some elements appear more than once which are connected via vertical links

Kind of like an express lane in an highway

## Search
If there are n elements in the list, there should be $\sqrt{n}$ elements in the list above it (call it m)
The cost of search becomes m + n/m or $\sqrt{n} + \frac{n}{\sqrt{n}} = 2\sqrt{n}$

In each row at most 2 elements are accessed
So time complexity becomes O(logn)

## Delete/Insert
Removing and adding elements may disturb the structure of the skip list
### Delete
Find the element and delete it and delete it from all of the "super"lists that contain it

Delete both
### Insert
Always insert at the bottom list
Then flip a coin on whether it is put onto the next level (50% chance to add to lane above)
You keep doing the coin toss for moving the node above until it is at the top list or until the flip is tails and you don't add it

More dynamic that sorted arrays, more memory effecient than trees
Good for parallelism 
Simple
Approx queries are faster
