# Randomized algos

## Hiring problem

* You are running an employment agency where you get sent a candidate a day for n days
* You interview and if they are better (ie higher) you immediately hire and fire the old one
* Cost to interview is Ci and cost to hire is Ch assume Ch > Ci
* Total Cost: O(Cin + Chm)

Worst case: Ex1, O(c1n)
### Probabilistic analysis
Assume random order
We have to enumerate all possible inputs, get running time, get average
	Difficult to apply
We can also use indicator random variable
	Analyze the average contribution to each member of the input to the total running time/cost and then sum it up
	Converts probability to expectations

For candidate i= n, P(getting hired) = 1/i since theres a 1/i chance that it is bigger than the previous element

Therefore the time complexity for average case is O(1)

## Analysis of randomized algorithim
* Probabilistic analysis of a deterministic algorithim
	* Input is random
	* Always same running time
	* Average case running-time
* Randomized algorithim
	* Input is anything and then we randomize
	* Expected running time over input
	* Randomizing is O(n)
