#  Recurrence 

## Substitution Method

2 general steps:
	1. Guess the form of the solution (prove O and Î© seperately)
	2. Prove by induction
```
Ex: T(n) = 4T(n/2) + n
Guess: T(n) = O(n^3)
Prove T(n) <= cn^3 by induction

= 4c(n/2)^3 + n
= c/2*n^3 + n
smth idk 
```

## Recursion Tree Method
Recursion tree models running time of recursion
	Each node represents the cost of a certain problem
	Sum costs of each level then sum all per level costs to get total cost
	This method is unreliable though

This gives an intuitive solution which could still be wrong

## *Master method*
Used to solve problems like: T(n) = aT(n/b) +f(n) where a>0 and b > 1
### Case 1:
You check to see if $n^{\log _b\left(a\right)}$ is bigger by a polynomial factor than f(n)
If true then: T(n) = $\theta$ ($n^{\log _b\left(a\right)}$)
Another way is to see if $n^{\log _b\left(a\right)-\epsilon} >= f(n)$ where $\epsilon > 0$
Ex: T(n) = 4T(n/2) + n
 $f(n)= n$ and $=n^{\log _2\left(4\right)-\epsilon} = n^1$ so $T(n) = \theta(n^2))$ 

### Case 2:
If case 1 can't be applied then you take $f(n)=n^{\log _b\left(a\right)}$ and multiply it by $\log n$ 
For this to work $n^{\log _b\left(a\right)} == f(n)$ 
Another note is that if the equation is  $T(n) = 4T(n/2)+ n^2*log^k(x)$, $k>= 0$  
Ex: 
$T(n) = 4T(n/2)+ n^2$   
$n^{2-1}$ is not $<= n^2$ so case 1 does not apply. 
$n^{2}== f(n) = n^2$ so Case 2 applies

Instead $T(n) = \theta(n^2logn)$  

### Case 3: 
Case 3 applied when $n^{\log _b\left(a\right)} < f(n)$ then $\theta(n) = f(n)$
Ex: 
$T(n) = 4T(n/2)+ n^3$   
$=n^{\log _2\left(4\right)} = n^{2} < n^3$ so $\theta(n^3)$ 


## Binary Search
Find the middle
if middle is bigger, search left
else search right

$T(n) = 1*T(n) + \theta(1)$
$n^{\log _b\left(a\right)} = n^{\log _2\left(1\right)} = n^{0}= 1$  
$1 == f(n) = \theta(1)$ therefore we apply Master method case 2
Case 2: $T(n) = \theta(f(n)*\log n) = \theta(\log n)$  

## Strassen Method
Do more addition than multiplication
$T(n) = 7T\left(\frac{n}{2}\right) + \theta(n^2)$ 
$n^{\log _b\left(a\right)} = n^{\log _2\left(7\right)} = n^{2.807...}$ which is asymptotically better than $n^3$
