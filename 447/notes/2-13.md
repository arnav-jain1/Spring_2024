# Why Normalization
Normalization is the process of reducing redudancy in a database
Why? 
	1. It wastes disk space
	2. Insertion anomalies (such as creating a new class that doesn't have any enrollments yet) ![[Pasted image 20240213124025.png]]
	3. Increases likelihood of inconsistencies
	4. Makes it harder to delete specific things
It is better to decompose and take one large table and make it into smaller tables so that it can be updated individually ![[Pasted image 20240213124251.png]]
DO NOT decompose too much to the point where it is redundant yet again such as decomposing the right most table into two seperate labels

# Functional Dependency 

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Functional Dependency  </mark> (denoted by X --> Y where X and Y are sets of attributes in relation R): If two tuples in R have the same X attribute(s) they must have the same Y attribute(s)
![[Pasted image 20240213125002.png]]
Alt Def: X --> Y means $T_{1}[X] = T_{2}[X] \iff T_{1}[Y] = T_{2}[Y]$  Where X and Y is $\ge$ 1

Trivial dependency is if X --> Y and Y is a subset of X
	Ex: (SID, SName, Department) --> SName
Completely non trivial if X and Y have no overlap
Can be partially non trivial if some but not all overlap

## Keys pt 2
An attribute set is a candidate key if:
	1. They functionally determine all other attributes (It is impossible for 2 of the same attribute sets being the same)
	2. No subset can functionally determine all other attributes of R
Set of attributes that has a key is called a superkey

# Normalization
Normalization: Process of decomposing bad relations by decomposing them into good ones
Normal form: Certification that tells whether the relational schema in a particular state
## First normal form
2 traits
1. It's a table, Every row-column intersection has ONE atomic value
2. Primary key is enforced
	No duplicate rows
	Rows are identified by primary key and columns by attribute name
	Values accessed by primary key of tuple and name of attribute (row and col)
## Second normal form
In first normal form AND Every non-prime attribute is fully dependent on candidate key
	Prime means member of candidate key
	This means that any non candidate key attribute must be tied to the candidate key itself, not a part of the candidate key
	![[Pasted image 20240213135554.png]]
	This is not Second Normal form because account and name has a partial dependency on
