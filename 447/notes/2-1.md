## Keys
* Super key: 
	* key(s) that can uniquely indentify a row on a table
	* Can be many
	* Can consist of 1+ attributes
	* Can have redundant attributes
		* Ex: SSN and haircolor are one superkey but just ssn is also a superkey
* Candidate Key
	* Super key but no redundant attributes
	* One attribute only not a tuple
	* There can be multiple candidate keys but each candidate key can only be one attribute
		* Ex: Phone Number and SSN are unique and can be candidate keys
* Primary Key
	* One of the candidate keys that is chosen by the user
* Foreign key
	* A key that is used to refer to a tuple (row) in another relation
	* All SID in 'enrolled' table must line up with one in the 'students' table

## Other info
* It is good practice to merge 1:1 relationships into one table
* Or use a foreign key that is a total participant
* For weak entity sets borrow a key from the superclass
* You want the relationship to have the key 
	* So WorksOn would have the key in this spot ![[Pasted image 20240201144738.png]]
