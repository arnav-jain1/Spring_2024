## Codasyl explained
* Essentially, its like a filing cabinet organized in a super specific way. You get a bunch of records from each query and then you keep going through each query to get the information you want

## System R
* Included many features
  * SQL
  * Query Processing 
  * Views
  * etc

## SQL
* Ingres implemented Quel
* System R implemented Structured Englished Query Language (SEQUEL) 
* Oracle V2: First commercially available SQL implementation
  * Based on System R

## Relational Model
* Relational Algebra
* Relational Calculus
  * Tuple relational calculus
  * domain relational calculus
  * Same thing

## NoSQL
* Problems with SQL:
  * Not good for large scale web-apps
  * Don't need perfect real time consistency always (googling)
* NoSQL = Not only SQL
* Example: Social networks
  * Friendships graphs would make a huge table
  * Query: Find all friends of friends of friends of ... 
    * Would take forever in SQL since hard to optimize
* 3 major papers contributed to NoSQL
  * BigTable (google)
  * Dynamo (Amazon)
  * CAP Theorem

## What is a database? 

* Large, interconnected set of data
* Data: facts that can be measured and recorded
* DBMS: Enables uses to create and maintain databases
  * Allow specification of schemas
  * Query and modify big data   

## Database design
* Conceptual design: Sketch the design
* Used to model reality
  
## E/R Model
* Most common model to describe the world
* High level
* ABout entity sets and relationships
  * Entity Set: Collection of similar entities [Rectangles used]
  * Entity: SPecific object in the mini-world
    * Attributes: property of an object (Simple values like vars) [Circles Used]
* Relationships connection between entity sets
  * Relates distinct entities with different meanings 
  * Grouped into relationship types
  * Portrayed by diamonds

## Attribute
* SImple: Single attomic value (Sex. SSN) 
* Composite: Composed of different components (name) [circle from other circle]
* Single value: At most one value (SSN)
* Multivalued: Multiple values (classes)
* Stored: Information that is stored and doesn't change unless more information is given (name)
* Derived: Information that changes automatically (grade, age)
* NULL Values: Empty values (no middle name, no address)
