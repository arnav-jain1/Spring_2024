# Nested queries (subqueries)
Queries inside parenthesis used for other queries 
Usually not needed
3 classes:
	Single values in WHERE
	Relations in FROM (least important)
	Relations in WHERE
## Single values in WHERE
If the subquery will 100% produce one value then the value can be used in the WHERE statement
	If there is 0 or >1 tuple or >1 attribute it might have a runtime error
Example:
	Find bars that sell Miller for the same price that Joe's bar chargers for Bud
	SELECT price FROM sells WHERE bar = 'Joe' AND beer = 'Bud'; 
		to find price
	SELECT bar FROM sells WHERE beer = 'Miller' AND price = (SELECT price FROM sells WHERE bar = 'Joe' AND beer = 'Bud');

## Relations to be used in FROM 
Can usually just do a join instead
Essentially querying the subquery 
Must have a variable name for the tuple
Example:
	Find beers liked by at least one person who goes to Joe's
	SELECT beer FROM likes, (SELECT drinker FROM frequents WHERE bar = 'Joe') JD WHERE likes.drinker = JD.drinker;
	Could also do this via join
## Relations to be used in WHERE

### In operator
tuple *IN* (subquery) is true if the tuple is in the subquery
NOT IN is self explanitory 
Example:
	Find name and manufac of each beer fred likes
	SELECT * FROM Beers WHERE name IN (SELECT beer FROM likes WHERE drinker = 'Fred')
	Also can be done using JOIN

## Quantified queries 
<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Kinda useful</mark>
For all: WHERE attr *operation* ALL (subquery) 
	If the operation is >, then its true when attr > all elements of subquerry
	Example: 
		Find the person with the highest salary
		SELECT * FROM employee WHERE salary >= ALL (SELECT salary FROM employee)
For any: WHERE attr *operation* ANY (subquery)
	If the operation is >, then its true when attr > at least one element of subquerry

EXISTS: EXISTS (subquery)
	True if the subquery is not empty
	Can do NOT EXISTS as well
	Not really that useful
