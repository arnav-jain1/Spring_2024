Entity set translates directly to a table
	Attributes --> columns
	Key attributes --> Primary Key]

Composite attributes are flattened into one for simplicity
relationship relation: the table that connects the 2 relationships
Multivalued attributes:
	When translating ER model to actual relational database, multivalued attributes can't be represented directly
	A new table is created with the primary key from the original entity as the foreign key so that it is linked
1:1 relationships:
	Sometimes merged into one because it is easier
	Or, the entity type with total participation is chosen as the foreign key
		Total participation is when one entity has to be connected to another entity for it to exist
	Generally, a new class has to be created that connects the two classes together. The new class is called the relationship relation

1:N
	Can either create a new class for the relationship relation
	Or in the many class use the primary key of the one class as a foreign key

M:N
	Use multiple candidate keys because to find the unique one you need both elements

Weak Entity set
	Must write the primary key that it is borrowing as a candidate key
	Make sure no name overlap
