# Aggregates
Used for finding min, max, average, etc.
Include COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX among others
	COUNT(\*) to count number of queries
Included in the SELECT part of the query 
Example:
	How many students are taking classes?
	SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT SID) FROM Enroll;
## NULL
NULL never contributes to average, sum, or count (min/max ignores it too)
	It is just skipped over and ignored
If there are no non-NULL values then the result of the aggregation is NULL
	Except with count then the result is 0

## GROUP BY
... WHERE ... GROUP BY *attr*
	This will group the output by the attribute and the aggregation will be applied to each group
Example:
	SELECT age, AVG(gpa) FROM Student GROUP BY age;
	This will group students by age and get the average gpa of each group
Aggregate without GROUP BY treats it as one big group

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">If a query uses group by then every column in SELECT must be aggregated or part of the GROUP BY</mark>
This is done so there is ONE attribute per group
Invalid examples (Invalid parts bold and have a strike through):
	SELECT **~~sid~~**, age FROM Student GROUP BY age;
		One row per group, SID will have multiple
	SELECT **~~sid~~**, MAX(gpa) FROM Student;
		Wrong because MAX(gpa) has one output and sid has many
		This will instead get the first student and then the maximum GPA
## Having
Filters groups based on properties
Essentially like a WHERE but for groups instead
Examples:
	SELECT age, AVG(GPA), FROM Student GROUP BY age HAVING age > 10;
	Average gpa for each age group above 10
	SELECT age, AVG(GPA), FROM Student GROUP BY age HAVING COUNT(\*) > 100;
	Same thing but each age group must have over 100 people
Can also have subquery in the HAVING area
The subquery can refer to anything
Outside of subqueries, anything in HAVING must be in a grouping attribute or aggregated
	Same thing as SELECT
