# Join
Distinguish attributes by doing table_name.attribute_name
	Not needed if the attribute name is unique
	Can also put alias after the table name like ... FROM BEER b, ...
When doing join, it becomes a cross product so you want to make sure you are lining it up with a specific variable
	WHERE t1.ssn = t2.ssn
The rest is pretty much the same
Examples:
	SIDs and names of students in EECS447
	SELECT Student.SID and Student.name FROM Student, Enroll WHERE Student.SID = Enroll.SID and Enroll.CID = 'EECS447'

## Self Join
Sometimes you need to use two copies of the same relation
Make sure you put an alias after each table name to distinguish it 
	FROM Beers b1, Beers b2 ...

## Explicit join
You can do 
	SELECT * FROM R INNER JOIN S ON R.p = S.p
Which is the same as 
	SELECT * FROM R, S WHERE R.p = S.p
Example:
	Get director of cruises that use ships built by Ajax
	SELECT Director FROM SHIP, CRUISE WHERE SHIP.shipnum = CRUISE.shipnum AND SHIP.builder = 'Ajax'
	OR
	SELECT Director FROM SHIP INNER JOIN CRUISE ON SHIP.shipnum = CRUISE.shipnum WHERE SHIP.builder = 'Ajax'
Natural join will implicitly match the same columns so it would automatically match shipnums together you wouldn't have to specify
	SELECT Director FROM SHIP NATURAL JOIN CRUISE ...

## Null vals
NULL is a placeholder for missing or incomplete attribute 
Aggregate functions ignore NULL except COUNT
Doing arithmetic with NULL is NULL
	1 + NULL - 10 * 2 = NULL
When using comparisons with NULL the result is UNKNOWN (even NULL = NULL)
	SELECT * FROM Student WHERE GPA = NULL;
	This will return nothing because comparisions always return unknown
Instead IS NULL and IS NOT NULL were added to check
